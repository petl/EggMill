## Motivation
<p>A while ago we've started an indoor compost in our flat. This so called <a href=\'https://wurmkiste.at/\'>'worm box'</a> is filled with earthworms and other helpful organisms. Those break down our leftover vegetables and give us ultra healthy humus and fertilizer for our plants. Every now and then the box need some minerals for the worms to grow big and strong and to avoid flies to grow. This mineral mix can be bought, but also home made out of dried egg shells. The shells accumulate almost on their own, just grinding them down with mortar and pestle is quite a time consuming task. A couple of days ago we\'ve gotten our hands on a broken coffee machine with integrated grinder and the solution was born.</p><br>
